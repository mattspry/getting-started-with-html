    <p><b>The World Wide Web</b>
<br>
The web is a collection of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) documents, and currently contains over 30bn pages. Pages are navigated using hyperlinks.
</p>
<p><b>Major web elements</b>
  <br>
  Ther are four major elements:<br>
  1 - web-user - you!<br>
  2 - a computer with web-browser e.g. Chrome, Firefox<br>
  3 - the internet<br>
  4 - servers<br>
  <p>When a user accesses the web using their pc and browser, they are sending a request via the web to access a webpage stored on a server. HTTP is used to access the webpage that is stored on the server.</p>
<p><b>HTML</b><br>
  HTML consists of:<br>
  text content - <em>what you see</em><br>
  markup - <em>what the html looks like</em><br>
  references to other html documents - <em>such as videos and images</em><br>
  links to other pages -  <em>hyperlinks</em></p>
<p><b>HTML markup</b><br>
  <p>HTML markup is the syntax used to structure content in a HTML document. It consists of <em>elements</em>, in which the content is prefixed by opening tags and suffixed by closing tags - together these tags determine how your content is presented. Tags can be nested to apply multiple factors.</p>
  <p>Common tags allow you to apply bold or italic formatting to your content, add line breaks or structure your content in paragraphs.</p>
<p>Tags also allow you to include images, links to other websites or videos in your content</p>
<p>Most tags require an opening and closing tag - however some tags are <em>void</em> tags, and require no closing tag as they are self enclosed e.g. the image tag that brings an image into your html, inserting a line break.</p>
<p>HTML defaults to <em>inline</em> presentation i.e. a continuous stream of content. Certain tags create <em>blocks</em> within your content, allowing them to be presented better and adjusted discretely by CSS or JS.</p>
<p><em>Span</em> and <em>div</em> elements define blocks of content in either inline (span) or block (div) states.</p>
<p><b>HTML documents</b><br>
  HTML markup is structured into HTML documents that allow web browsers to interpret and present content correctly. HTML documents are structured into <em>head</em> and <em>body</em> sections. Head sections contain metedata e.g. CSS and JS links, webpage title, whilst the body section contains the webpage content.
